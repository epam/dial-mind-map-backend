  #### **GOOD** Correct Merging (Handling Redundant Facts)

  If you find multiple facts that are clearly redundant, synthesize them into one statement and merge their `source_ids`.

  *   **Input Concepts:**
    ```json
    [
      {
        "name": "US Fiscal Policy Challenges",
        "answer": [
          {
            "fact": "A key challenge for policymakers is balancing the budget, which often requires unpopular choices about which taxes to increase or spending areas to reduce.",
            "source_ids": [ 2 ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Political Hurdles to Debt Reduction",
        "answer": [
          {
            "fact": "Fiscal consolidation is difficult due to the electoral cycle and political polarization, making it hard to raise revenue or cut expenditures.",
            "source_ids": [ 5 ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
    ```
  *   **Reasoning:** Both facts describe the same core problem: the political difficulty of fiscal consolidation. They are redundant.
  *   **Correct Merged Output:**
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Political Challenges of Fiscal Consolidation",
      "answer": [
        {
          "fact": "Fiscal consolidation is a key challenge for policymakers, often requiring politically unpopular choices about which taxes to raise or spending areas to cut, a difficulty exacerbated by the electoral cycle and political polarization.",
          "source_ids": [ 2, 5 ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

  #### **BAD** Incorrect Merging (Handling Distinct Facts)

  If facts describe different ideas, you MUST keep them as separate objects in the `answer` list.

  *   **Input Concepts:**
    ```json
    [
        { "name": "US National Debt", "answer": [{ "fact": "The US national debt has exceeded \$30 trillion in recent years.", "source_ids": }] },
        { "name": "US Agricultural Policy", "answer": [{ "fact": "The government provides significant subsidies for corn production.", "source_ids": }] }
    ]
    ```
  *   **Reasoning:** The national debt and corn subsidies are two separate, distinct facts. They are not redundant.
  *   **INCORRECT Output (DO NOT DO THIS):**
    ```json
    // This is WRONG because it merges two unrelated facts.
    {
      "name": "US Economic Policy",
      "answer": [
        {
          "fact": "The US national debt has exceeded \$30 trillion, and the government provides significant subsidies for corn production.",
          "source_ids": [ 1, 4 ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  *   **CORRECT Output (Keep Facts Separate):**
    ```json
    {
      "name": "US Economic Policy",
      "answer": [
        {
          "fact": "The US national debt has exceeded \$30 trillion in recent years.",
          "source_ids": [ 1 ]
        },
        {
          "fact": "The government provides significant subsidies for corn production.",
          "source_ids": [ 4 ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

  #### **VERY BAD** Incorrect Merging in the Root Concept (Hallucination)

  This is the most critical error to avoid. Do not merge distinct facts into a single statement in the `RootConcept`.

  *   **Input Concepts (Simplified from your example):**
    ```json
    [
        { "name": "Global Economic Outlook", "answer": [{ "fact": "The global economy in 2024 is shaped by shifting US economic indicators, rising business insolvencies, and significant monetary policy changes.", "source_ids": [2, 3, 4, 5] }] },
        { "name": "Tech Solutions", "answer": [{ "fact": "Technological solutions such as DIAL Chat have become increasingly accessible, with both local deployment guides and SaaS editions available.", "source_ids": [1] }] }
    ]
    ```
  *   **INCORRECT (Hallucinated Synthesis - DO NOT DO THIS):**
    ```json
    // This is WRONG because it invents a relationship between economics and a specific tech tool.
    {
      "name": "Global Economic and Technological Evolution",
      "answer": [
        {
          "fact": "The global landscape is defined by interconnected shifts in economic indicators and the increasing accessibility of advanced digital solutions like DIAL Chat.",
          "source_ids": [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] // Incorrectly merged sources
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  *   **CORRECT (Preserving Distinct Facts in the Root):**
    ```json
    // This is CORRECT because it keeps the distinct facts separate, each with its own sources.
    {
      "name": "Global Economic and Technological Trends",
      "answer": [
        {
          "fact": "The global economy in 2024 is shaped by shifting US economic indicators, rising business insolvencies, and significant monetary policy changes.",
          "source_ids": [ 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
        },
        {
          "fact": "Technological solutions such as DIAL Chat have become increasingly accessible, with both local deployment guides and SaaS editions available.",
          "source_ids": [ 1 ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  

deduplication: >
  **Example of Merging Facts:**


  Suppose you are given these two input concepts:


  *   **Input Concept 1:**
      ```json
      {{
        "id": 101,
        "name": "US Fiscal Policy Challenges",
        "answer": [{{
          "fact": "A key challenge for policymakers is balancing the budget,
  which often requires unpopular choices about which taxes to increase or
  spending areas to reduce.",
          "source_ids": [2]
        }}]
      }}
      ```


  *   **Input Concept 2:**
      ```json
      {{
        "id": 102,
        "name": "US Fiscal Policy Challenges",
        "answer": [{{
          "fact": "Fiscal consolidation is difficult due to the electoral cycle
  and political polarization, making it hard to raise revenue or cut
  expenditures.",
          "source_ids": [5]
        }}]
      }}
      ```


  Because the facts describe different aspects of the same core problem, you
  could choose to create two more specific concepts or merge them. If merging,
  the correct output would be a new `SynthesizedConcept` like this:


  *   **Resulting SynthesizedConcept:**
      ```json
      {{
        "name": "Political and Economic Challenges of US Fiscal Consolidation",
        "question": "What political and economic challenges make US fiscal
  consolidation difficult?",
        "source_concept_ids": [101, 102],
        "answer": [{{
          "fact": "A key challenge for policymakers is balancing the budget,
  which requires unpopular choices about taxes or spending, and is further
  complicated by the electoral cycle and political polarization.",
          "source_ids": [2, 5]
        }}]
      }}
      ```
  
  
  Notice how the two similar facts are combined into one complete statement,
  their `source_ids` `[2]` and `[5]` are merged into `[2, 5]`, and the
  `source_concept_ids` are listed as `[101, 102]`.

root_deduplication: >
  **Example Scenario:**
  
  
  Suppose you are given these three input concepts, where ID `25` is the
  designated root:
  
  
  *   **Input Concept 1:**
      ```
      Concept (ID: 25) **[THIS IS THE ROOT CONCEPT]**
      --------------------
      Name: "US Debt Sustainability"
      Question: "What are the main factors affecting US debt?"
      Answer: [{{ "fact": "The sustainability of US public debt is shaped by the
  interplay of economic growth and interest rates.", "source_ids": [1] }}]
      ```
  
  
  *   **Input Concept 2:**
      ```
      Concept (ID: 26)
      --------------------
      Name: "US Debt Sustainability"
      Question: "What determines if US debt is sustainable?"
      Answer: [{{ "fact": "Fiscal policy choices and demographic pressures like
  Social Security are key factors for debt sustainability.", "source_ids": [3] 
  }}]
      ```
  
  
  *   **Input Concept 3:**
      ```
      Concept (ID: 27)
      --------------------
      Name: "US Debt Sustainability"
      Question: "How does the US dollar's status affect its debt?"
      Answer: [{{ "fact": "The US's unique position as the reserve currency 
  provides flexibility in managing its debt obligations.", "source_ids": [8] }}]
      ```
  
  
  Because Concepts `25` and `26` describe the same core factors, they should be
  merged into the root. Concept `27` is related but distinct enough to become
  its own concept.
  
  
  *   **Correct Output:**
      ```json
      {{
        "root_concept": {{
          "name": "Key Factors in US Debt Sustainability",
          "question": "What are the key factors, risks, and mechanisms shaping
  the sustainability of US public debt?",
          "source_concept_ids": [25, 26],
          "answer": [{{
            "fact": "The sustainability of US public debt is shaped by the
  interplay of economic growth, interest rates, fiscal policy choices, and
  demographic pressures like Social Security.",
            "source_ids": [1, 3]
          }}]
        }},
        "concepts": [
          {{
            "name": "US Reserve Currency Status and Debt Flexibility",
            "question": "How does the US dollar's reserve currency status affect
  its debt management?",
            "source_concept_ids": [27],
            "answer": [{{
              "fact": "The US's unique position as the holder of the world's

  obligations.",
              "source_ids": [8]

  ### Critical Example: Applying the Topic Isolation Rule
  
  This example demonstrates the mandatory procedure from Rule #1.
  
  *   **Input `answer`:**
      ```
      The US faces significant fiscal challenges due to rising national debt and evolving interest rate outlooks.^[19.1.1]^^[19.1.2]^ Generative AI tools are seeing wider adoption for content creation.^[13.1.1]^
      ```
  *   **Styling Instruction:** `"Restyle in a formal, academic tone."`

  ---
  
  #### **Mandatory Analysis Process:**
  
  1.  **Identify Topics:** I see two distinct topics in the input.
      *   **Topic A: US Economics** (facts about debt and interest rates from sources 19.x).
      *   **Topic B: AI Technology** (fact about AI tools from source 13.x).
  
  2.  **Determine Output Structure:** Because there are two unrelated topics, the output **MUST** be a bulleted list.
  
  3.  **Style Each Topic Separately.**
  
  ---
  
  *   **Incorrect Output (Forbidden Synthesis):**
      ```
      The US economic and financial environment in 2024-2025 is characterized by evolving interest rate outlooks, monetary policy risks, and the adoption of technological tools to enhance productivity.^[13.1.1]^^[19.1.1]^^[19.1.2]^
      ```
      *(This is **WRONG**. It violates Rule #1 by mixing **Topic A** and **Topic B** into a single sentence, forcing a hallucinated connection.)*
  
  *   **Correct Output (Required Structure):**
      ```
      *   The United States faces notable economic challenges, including rising national debt and evolving outlooks on interest rates.^[19.1.1]^^[19.1.2]^
      *   In a separate trend, generative AI tools are being more widely adopted for content creation applications.^[13.1.1]^
      ```
      *(This is **CORRECT**. It follows the procedure by identifying the two topics and isolating them into a bulleted list, styling each one independently.)*
